Harden MQTT
================

This project is aimed at students learning IoT communication over MQTT, as well as teachers, and how to harden their 
implementations so they avoid most common mistakes and vulnerabilities when using MQTT. It shows how to use MQTT to transmit
sensor data in the following ways:

* Unsecured
	* Unstructured
	* Structured
	* Interoperable
* Secured
	* Cryptographically Signed & public
	* Signed and encrypted

Signatures are based on public key cryptography, where public keys are transmitted over MQTT as well, and private keys are used
to sign information being published. The Twister Edwards Curve `Ed25519` is used in these examples.

For encryption to be done, a hybrid cipher is used, where the asymetric ciphers (`Ed25519`) are used to derive shared secrets
using `EdDSA` and `SHA3-256`. These shared secrets are then used by a symmetric cipher (`AES-256`). As these shared secrets are 
never transmitted, they can be used to securely to encrypt the content being communicated. 

To achieve this level of encryption, pairing of devices and sensors have to be performed. This is also done publicly, but
securely over MQTT, highlighting the fact that malicious users can hijack the pairing process as well, if able to. Public key
cryptography and signatures are vital for the pairing process to be secured.

Projects
---------

This repository consists of the following projects. They are developed in C#.

| Project            | Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| [Sensor](Sensor)   | A command-line app that represents a simple sensor that gets its values from the Internet and publishes it on an MQTT Broker. It publishes the information in five different ways: Unstructured, Structured, Interoperable (first three unsecured), and public, Confidential (last two secured). |
| [Display](Display) | A command-line app that acts as a display for sensor information published by the Sensor project. It displays information generated by all five methods transmitted. |
| [Troll](Troll)     | A command-line app that spies on communication and tries to prohibit or alter information sent by sensors connected on the MQTT broker. Run this on the same broker as the sensor and display applications, to make it difficult for them to operate. |
| [Pairing](Pairing) | A class library that helps with the task of pairing two devices securely, over MQTT. |

For the Teacher
-----------------

You can find a proposed [Lab](LAB.md) in this repository, divided into three sessions, where studens learn to communicate over
MQTT, then learn about common vulnerabilities, and finally how to harden their solutions for these vulnerabilities. The projects
available in this repository can be run simultaneously during the lab, everyone using the same MQTT broker as shared infrastructure.
