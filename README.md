Harden MQTT
================

This project is aimed at professors teaching and students learning IoT communication over MQTT, and how to harden their 
implementations so they avoid most common mistakes and vulnerabilities when using MQTT.

Projects
---------

This repository consists of the following projects. They are developed in C#.

| Project            | Description |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| [Sensor](Sensor)   | This project implements a simple sensor that gets its values from the Internet and publishes it on an MQTT Broker. It publishes the information in three different ways: Unsecured, Secured but public, Secured and Confidential. |
| [Display](Display) | This project presents sensor information published by the Sensor project. It displays information generated by all three methods transmitted. |
| [Troll](Troll)     | This project tries to spy on, prohibit or alter information sent by sensors connected on the MQTT broker. |

For the Teacher
-----------------

You can find a proposed [Lab](LAB.md) in this repository, divided into three sessions, where studens learn to communicate over
MQTT, then learn about common vulnerabilities, and finally how to harden their solutions for these vulnerabilities. The projects
available in this repository can be run simultaneously during the lab, everyone using the same MQTT broker as shared infrastructure.
